# Library Management System

## Overview

The Library Management System is a Python-based application designed to manage a library's collection of books. The system provides functionality for adding books, borrowing books, returning books, and viewing available books. This project is developed following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and adheres to clean coding practices.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- **`.vscode/pycache`**: Contains configuration files for the Visual Studio Code editor.
- **`directory_name`**: Placeholder for any additional directories or files you may add.
- **`katalibrary/pycache`**: Contains the implementation code for the library management system.
- **`UnitTestPython/pycache`**: Contains unit tests for the library management system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kasyap-cloud/katalibrary.git
   cd library-management-system
  ```
```bash  
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Future Improvements
Implement data persistence (database integration)
Add user authentication and authorization
Implement a graphical user interface
Add more advanced search and filter options for books

### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to design and implement a basic library management system while adhering to best practices in software development. The system is built with a focus on maintainability, scalability, and reliability, ensuring that it meets the requirements of the Incyubyte campus placement drive technical round.

### Thank You
